Ingredients:
- For the Parfaits:
- 1 ½ cups raspberries, rinsed and drained
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 cup blueberries, rinsed and drained
- 1 ½ cups granola
- For the Frozen Yogurt:
- 2 cups full-fat plain Greek yogurt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- ½ cup white sugar

Steps:
1. Combine raspberries and ½ cup white sugar in a bowl. Crush with a potato masher into a puree. Cover and let sit out for 1 hour.
2. Pass berry puree through a fine mesh strainer to remove seeds. Add blueberries, stir, and keep in the refrigerator until needed.
3. Whisk yogurt, vanilla, lemon zest, and sugar for frozen yogurt together in a bowl until sugar dissolves and the mixture is light and fluffy. Transfer into a piping bag and refrigerate until needed.

To Build Parfaits:
5. Add 2 tablespoons of granola into an 8-ounce jar, or similar vessel. Top with 2 tablespoons of the fruit mixture. Try to make sure some of the fruit sauce is touching the glass so you can see the layers when frozen. Top with 2 heaping tablespoons of the yogurt mixture. Repeat twice more for a total of 3 layers. Top can be garnished with any remaining fruit and sauce.
6. Freeze until frozen solid, about 8 hours, or overnight.
