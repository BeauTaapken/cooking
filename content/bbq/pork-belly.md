# Pulled Pork

## Rubs

There are a number of rubs you can use for pulled pork, you can either make them or purchase them to use for the recipe. 

*Note*, I would highly reccomend avoiding BBQ rubs that already contains the salt since that means you have no control over the salt level of your piece of meat.

### Classic S&P

- Salt
- Black Pepper

### Sweet & Savory

- 30g Brown sugar
- 8g Smoked paprika
- 3g garlic powder
- 3g onion powder
- 2g black pepper
- 1.5g ground mustard
- 1g cayenne pepper (optional)

## Steps

1. Score the fat if available & season w/ rub.
2. After 3 to 4 hours in the smoker or BBQ at 121째C 
3. After those 3 to 4 hours start spraying with apple cider vinegar (Apple bandit also works fine) solution (avoid spraying fat) and continue to spray every 30 - 45 minutes until wrapping
4. After 6 hours in the smoker check for tenderness and if the internal temp has reached the desired, if your temp is close to 96째C and your probe easily pierces it like butter sinks into fat when you poke it, then it is time to wrap
*Note*: the internal temp and feel of the meat (i.e. probes like butter) are the most important indicators that your meat is done cooking
5. If it does not seem to reach the desired temperature the consider Wrapping it tightly in 2 layers of heavy duty aluminum foil and place the wrapped meat back on the smoker (still 121째F) or in oven (at 121째F)

### Resting
When the meat is done cooking let it rest for at least 1 hour, then remove the bone(if with bone) and shred/pull apart pork as you want it to avoid drying it out

Enjoy your delicious meal!
