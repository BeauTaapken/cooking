# Pulled Pork

## Rubs

There are a number of rubs you can use for pulled pork, you can either make them or purchase them to use for the recipe. 

*Note*, I would highly reccomend avoiding BBQ rubs that already contains the salt since that means you have no control over the salt level of your piece of meat.

### Classic S&P

- Salt
- Black Pepper

### Classic southern BBQ Rub

- 30g Brown sugar
- 8gg Smoked paprika
- 8g garglic powder
- 8g onion powder
- 2.5g chili powder
- 2.5g black pepper
- 1g cayenne pepper (optional)

## Steps

1. Score the fat if available & season w/ rub.
2. 3 to 4 hours in the smoker or BBQ at 121°C 
3. After those 3 to 4 hours start spraying with apple cider vinegar (Apple bandit also works fine) solution (avoid spraying fat) and continue to spray every 30 - 45 minutes until wrapping
*Note*: at this point Jeremy checked his internal temp which was around 69°C, the target temp before wrapping is around 77°C. 
4. After 6 hours in the smoker check internal temp, if your temp is close to 77°C and your finger sinks into fat when you poke it, then it is time to wrap
5. If not leave it on the smoker until desired temp is reached and fat is rendered
6. Wrap tightly in 2 layers of heavy duty aluminum foil and place the wrapped meat back on the smoker (still 121°C) or in oven (at 121°C)
7. About 2 hours after wrapping, check temp, the target temp is 95-96°C
*Note*: the internal temp and feel of the meat (i.e. probes like butter) are the most important indicators that your meat is done cooking

### Resting
When the meat is done cooking let it rest for at least 1 hour, then remove the bone(if with bone) and shred/pull apart pork as you want it to avoid drying it out

Enjoy your delicious meal!
