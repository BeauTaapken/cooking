# Flour Tortillas 
The only struggled is with making them round this [video](https://youtu.be/j0gjlSgO7VU?t=64) helps with how you should roll them.
This is the [recipe](https://thecafesucrefarine.com/best-ever-homemade-flour-tortillas/) I followed when I was making them.
Making them round is really hard a [tortilla press](https://www.amazon.com/Victoria-TOR-003-FBA_TOR-003-Tortilla-Press/dp/B00HWEIKZO) could help with this.
