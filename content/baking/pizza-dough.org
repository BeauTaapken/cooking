Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 cups (530 ml) (38 celsius) warm water
- 1 tbsp sugar (12g) sugar
- 1 tbsp (9g) active dry yeast
- 2 tbsp (30 ml) olive oil
- 1 tbsp (18 g) kosher salt
- 5 cups (600g) bread flour, plus more for working the dough
- additional oil for greasing the dough
- cornmeal, semolina flour, or coarse-ground whole wheat flour for dusting

  Steps
  1. Bloom the yeast in a stand mixer bowl with the teaspoon of sugar and ¼ cup water.
  2. When it’s frothy, add the rest of the ingredients and mix with the dough hook until a smooth ball comes together. It should be only slightly sticky; if it’s very sticky, add additional flour.
  3. Divide dough into four equal parts, roll each into a smooth ball and place in its own, well-oiled bowl. Age in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up to a week.
