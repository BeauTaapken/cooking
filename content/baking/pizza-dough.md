Ingredients:
- 530 ml (38 celsius) warm water
- 12g sugar
- 9g active dry yeast
- 30 ml olive oil
- 18 g kosher salt
- 820 gr bread flour, plus potentially more for working the dough
- additional oil for greasing the dough
- cornmeal, semolina flour, or coarse-ground whole wheat flour for dusting

Important aim for between 65-60% hydration

  Steps
  1. Bloom the yeast in a stand mixer bowl with the teaspoon of sugar and ¼ cup water.
  2. When it’s frothy, add the rest of the ingredients and mix with the dough hook until a smooth ball comes together. It should be only slightly sticky; if it’s very sticky, add additional flour.
  3. If using a machine let it rest for 10 minutes before kneading another 5 minutes with the machine.
  4. Divide dough into four equal parts, roll each into a smooth ball and place in its own, well-oiled bowl. Age in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up to a week.
