# Mushroom risotto done with mushroom stock
## Ingredients
2 cups chicken broth, or as needed
2 cups mushroom stock or, or as needed
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced
white mushrooms, thinly sliced
15-30 grams of dried mushroom
2 medium shallots, diced
200 gram Arborio rice
118 ml dry white wine
4 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons finely chopped chives
â…“ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
## Steps
1. First make the mushrooms stock. Combine the dried mushrooms and a few bay leaves with about 2 cups (473mL) water per portion, a big pinch of salt per portion, bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 30-60 minutes, strain out the solids and discard them. (If there was a lot of sand on the dry mushrooms, you can either pass the stock through a coffee filter or just let the sand settle on the bottom and pour off everything but the last little bit.)

2. Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.

3. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.

4. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.

5. Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.

6. Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
