## Ingredients
- 1 large chicken, about 4 to 5 pounds (1.8 to 2.3kg)
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) light olive oil or other neutral-flavored oil, such as canola or vegetable, divided
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper (see note)
- 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder (optional; see note)
- 2 teaspoons (10g) chopped fresh parsley, thyme, rosemary, oregano, marjoram, savory, or a mix (optional)
## Directions
1. Place oven rack in upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (232°C). Using sharp kitchen shears, remove backbone from chicken and cut spine into 5 to 6 one-inch-long pieces. Set backbone aside. Flatten chicken by placing skin side up on a cutting board and applying firm pressure to breastbone. Transfer to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Position chicken so that breasts are aligned with center of baking sheet and legs are close to edge.

2. If using herbs: using your fingers and starting from the neck end and working your way down towards the legs, gently separate chicken skin from the breast and thigh meat; be careful not to tear the skin. Carefully push the herbs under the skin, distributing them as evenly as possible all over the breast and thigh muscle.

3. Combine 1 tablespoon (15g) kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, and 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder (if using) in a small bowl. Sprinkle all over chicken skin and cavity sides, then return to skin-up position. Drizzle chicken skin with 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil, rubbing to distribute evenly.

4. Roast chicken until thickest part of breast close to bone registers 150°F (66°C) on an instant-read thermometer and joint between thighs and body registers at least 175°F (80°C), about 45 minutes.

5. Remove chicken from oven, transfer to cutting board, tent loosely with foil, and allow to rest 5 minutes before carving.

## Notes
- Adding baking powder to the salt used on the chicken skin will give you extra-crispy results.
- If using a different type of salt, be sure to use the weight measurement, not the volume measurement.
