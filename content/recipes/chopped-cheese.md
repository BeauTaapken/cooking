# Chopped cheese

## Bread options

There are a number of different types of sandwich bread you can use such as a baguette. The only important factor is that they are able to contain the moisture of the ingredients alongside having a hard enough exterior to hold the sandwich together.

## Italian variant

### Sauce
- mayonnaise 1 part
- calabrian chilies, minced 1/2 part
- vinegar 1/4 part

### Toppings
- Tomato
- Lettuce

### Base
- ground beef 180 g
- salt
- msg
- onions, diced 1/4
- low-fat american cheese 1 slice 
- provolone 1 slice
- fresh mozzarella 1 slice

## Jalapeno Cheddar variant

### Sauce
- mayonnaise 1 part
- low-fat sour cream 1 part
- lime juice 1/2 part

### Toppings
- Tomato
- Lettuce

### Base
- ground beef 180 g
- salt
- msg
- onions, diced 1/4
- low-fat american cheese 1 slice 
- pickled jalape√±os, diced
- cheddar, grated

## Steps

1. Combine the ingredients listed for the sauce in a bowl, adjust to taste.
2. Next, set a pan or griddle over medium heat and add the ground beef. Sprinkle a bit of salt on top and add an optional pinch of MSG for extra flavor.
Sear the beef for 1-2 minutes without chopping it up. Then, add the onions on top of the beef and start breaking everything up with a spatula.
Cook for 2 more minutes or until the onions are soft and the beef is browned.

3. Steam the bread
While the beef is cooking, slice open your bread roll of choice and spread some of the sauce onto the interior of the bread.
Once the beef is done, add the cheese slices on top and then place the bread on top to let everything melt and crisp up for a minute.
Then, using a spatula to keep everything together, flip the sandwich over so that the roll is on the bottom and the meat and cheese are on top.

4. Finish and serve
To finish, top the beef and cheese mixture with some shredded lettuce. Then, add a few slices of seasoned tomatoes on top.
Transfer the roll to a sheet of aluminum foil and parchment paper and wrap everything up tightly. This will steam a bit and transform it into a true bodega experience.
Slice open the sandwich and enjoy.

## Note 
There will be some leftover sauce. Optionally, add another line of mayo to the sandwich.
